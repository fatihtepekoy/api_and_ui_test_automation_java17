# Cucumber 7 - JUnit 5 - Rest Assured 5 - Java 17 Api & UI Automation Project Skeleton

This is the simple and weel designed(best practices) setup for Cucumber 7, Junit 5, Rest Assured and using Java 17.

Also I wanted to give an example that how you can make your api automation test project structure. 
The packages and classes dummy named. 
It has a static method for getting token.(oauth2). All you need to configre it and call it. 
It has also a generic datatable configration class, so that you easly can read cucumber datatables. 

Feel free to give suggestions and your contributions. 
I will try to make this project work with an open api, so that you can easly run and see the test results.
